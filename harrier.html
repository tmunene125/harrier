        <h2>Specifications of a Harrier</h2>
        <p>Toyota Harrier was released for sale in December 1997. It was born as a Sports Utility Saloon that combines mobility and functionality of SUV with basic performance of a luxury car. Harrier has the same platform with Toyota Windom. However, comparing to Windom, total length and wheelbase of Harrier are shorter, while the width and height are extended and higher. Even though its minimum height from the ground is kept 185 mm, by preventing the seats becoming too high, Harrier achieved a smooth getting-on-and-off motion and an excellent bad terrain driving performance.
            The seats of Toyota Harrier are the two-row seats with a carrying capacity of five. The rear seat is provided with a reclining mechanism and can be folded in semi-flat in combination with the front seat. The seat can also be split into 60/40 with the ability to slide forward and backward. The shift lever is located in the central lower part of the instrumental panel, which enables side walk-through from the front seat.
